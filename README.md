# DBMS-Project

This project aims in building a database management system which 
analyzes the covid situation in hospitals. The database has 
information about the hospitals in different cities covid patients, 
health workers, symptoms, suppliers, supplies and covid variants. 
With this database, we can determine the covid status across places. 
We can keep record of the number of people affected, the variant 
type and number of deaths. Using this database, we can monitor the 
covid situation in hospitals across India.
